This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: accessing memory outside the allocated bounds of an array.  The `bug.asm` file contains the erroneous code, resulting in a segmentation fault.  The solution, found in `bugSolution.asm`, shows how to prevent this error by properly validating array indices before memory access.  Understanding memory boundaries is crucial for secure and stable assembly programs.
